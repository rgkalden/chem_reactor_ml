# Applying Machine Learning to Industrial Chemical Reactors

## Proof of Concept Reactor Model

Part 1: Project demonstrating how machine learning can be used to model the relationship between the process conditions and the overall yield of a chemical reactor.

Part 2: Project exploring how machine learning can improve process safety in chemical reactors by predicting if a reactor runaway will occur.
